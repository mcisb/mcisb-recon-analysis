recon_2.2.xml
is our set of iterative improvements to recon 2

[2.1.1]
* start with recon_2.1.xml
* remove abstract concept of limited carbon uptake
* replace in/ex exchange reaction pairs with single reactions
* limit glucose (M_glc_D_b), essential fatty acids (M_lnlc_b, M_lnlnca_b), amino acids (M_his_L_b, M_ile_L_b, M_leu_L_b, M_lys_L_b, M_met_L_b, M_phe_L_b, M_thr_L_b, M_trp_L_b, M_val_L_b) and vitamins (M_pnto_R_b, M_ribflv_b) to a supply rate of one unit
* other metabolites in the minimal medium (M_nh4_b, M_o2_b, M_pi_b, M_so4_b, M_ca2_b, M_cl_b, M_fe2_b, M_k_b, M_na1_b, M_h_b, M_h2o_b) have unlimited supply
* the resultant model has maximum growth rate 1.689
* .. though growth is independent of glucose

[2.1.2]
split biomass reaction into its constituent parts
biomass = protein + DNA + RNA + carbohydrate + lipid + other
as described in the recon 2 paper, supplementary note 2

[2.1.3]
* re-add CHARGE that went missing during the 2 -> 2.1 conversion
* add new transport reactions as described in http://identifiers.org/pubmed/24653705, and defined by TransportModule13820.mat
* .. and modifications to existing transporters described at the end of supplementary table 2

[2.1.4]
* add drug metabolism as described in http://identifiers.org/pubmed/25345908

[2.1.5]
* remove splice variants from the model
* correct GENE_ASSOCIATION bracketing error for R_ATPS4m
* rebuild GENE_ASSOCIATIONs in disjunctive normal form, with lists of alternative complexes: "(E1 and E2) or (E1 and E3)", rather than "E1 and (E2 or E3)"
