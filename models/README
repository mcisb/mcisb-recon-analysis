recon_2.2.xml
is our set of iterative improvements to recon 2

[2.1.1]
* start with recon_2.1.xml
* remove abstract concept of limited carbon uptake
* replace in/ex exchange reaction pairs with single reactions
* limit glucose (M_glc_D_b), essential fatty acids (M_lnlc_b, M_lnlnca_b), amino acids (M_his_L_b, M_ile_L_b, M_leu_L_b, M_lys_L_b, M_met_L_b, M_phe_L_b, M_thr_L_b, M_trp_L_b, M_val_L_b) and vitamins (M_pnto_R_b, M_ribflv_b) to a supply rate of one unit
* other metabolites in the minimal medium (M_nh4_b, M_o2_b, M_pi_b, M_so4_b, M_ca2_b, M_cl_b, M_fe2_b, M_k_b, M_na1_b, M_h_b, M_h2o_b) have unlimited supply
* the resultant model has maximum growth rate 1.689
* .. though growth is independent of glucose

[2.1.2]
split biomass reaction into its constituent parts
biomass = protein + DNA + RNA + carbohydrate + lipid + other
as described in the recon 2 paper, supplementary note 2

[2.1.3]
* re-add CHARGE that went missing during the 2 -> 2.1 conversion
* add new transport reactions as described in http://identifiers.org/pubmed/24653705, and defined by TransportModule13820.mat
* .. and modifications to existing transporters described at the end of supplementary table 2

[2.1.4]
* add drug metabolism as described in http://identifiers.org/pubmed/25345908

[2.1.5]
* remove splice variants from the model
* correct GENE_ASSOCIATION bracketing error for R_ATPS4m
* rebuild GENE_ASSOCIATIONs in disjunctive normal form, with lists of alternative complexes: "(E1 and E2) or (E1 and E3)", rather than "E1 and (E2 or E3)"

[2.1.20]
* note this update starts from the version 2.1.5
* automated balancing of model (including R-groups) ©neilswainston

[2.1.26, as per 2.1.6]
* make set of changes as described in http://identifiers.org/pubmed/24907410 and defined by Supplementary File 2
* the resultant model has reduced maximum growth rate 1.568

[2.1.27, as per 2.1.7]
* modify reaction bounds as described in http://identifiers.org/pubmed/25028891 tables 2&3
* remove R_G5SADs and merged R_AIRCr with R_PRASCS, as described in the same paper

[2.1.28, as per 2.1.8]
* move InChI strings from notes to annotation

[2.1.29, as per 2.1.9]
* remove some lumped reactions of the form x1 -> xN, where the constituent steps x1 -> x2 -> .. -> xN are present

[2.1.30]
* turn on mitochondrial phosphate transporter
* map genes to HGNC ©pauldobson
* add enzymes as modifiers
* the resultant model has increased maximum growth rate 1.612

[2.1.31]
* make R_r0016 irreversible, to avoid free generation of o2
* make R_RE0583N, R_RE1441G, R_RE1810M, R_RE1836C, R_RE1836M, R_RE1957G, R_RE2972G, R_RE2972R, R_RE2973G, R_RE2973N, R_RE2974G, R_RE2974N, R_RE2974R irreversible
* remove R_r1435
* modify some InChI strings

[2.1.32]
* add a couple of missing fatty-acid--CoA ligases and fatty-acid-CoA transporters

[2.1.34]
* fix polyol pathway
* check HGNC associations

[2.1.35]
* delete incorrect acyl-CoA transport and replace with missing cartinine shuttles

[2.1.36]
* redefine gene associations as per recon_2.04 (http://humanmetabolism.org/?page_id=75)
* re-remove splice variants, remap genes to HGNC [see gene_associations_2_1_36.txt] and re-add enzymes as modifiers
* made reactions with LB < 0 reversible

[2.2.01]
* final [?] version of recon 2.2

[2.2.02]
* removed some pseudogenes
