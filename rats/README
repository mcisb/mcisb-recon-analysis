This directory contains the reconstruction of rat metabolism (rambo.xml), derived from recon 2.2.

The script human_to_rat.py performs the transformation. The mapping ensembl_hgnc_to_rat.txt (as calculated in Ensembl Genes 80, GRCh38.p2) is used to map from the HGNC identifiers in the human reconstruction, to their Ensembl rat orthologues.

2-Jun-15:

Enzyme-catalysed human reactions that have no rat orthologue (for any isoenzyme) are removed. This happens in 84 cases, below. Uncatalysed (spontaneous or modelling) reactions are always kept. The resultant model cannot grow.
