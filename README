These files describe iterative improvements to the "recon 2" model of human metabolism (doi:10.1038/nbt.2488, biomodels:MODEL1109130000)


recon 2.1 (arXiv:1311.5696, biomodels:MODEL1311110000) is as described previously


recon 2.1.1

* removed abstract concept of limited carbon uptake
* replaced in/ex exchange reaction pairs with single reactions
* limited glucose (M_glc_D_b), essential fatty acids (M_lnlc_b, M_lnlnca_b), amino acids (M_his_L_b, M_ile_L_b, M_leu_L_b, M_lys_L_b, M_met_L_b, M_phe_L_b, M_thr_L_b, M_trp_L_b, M_val_L_b) and vitamins (M_pnto_R_b, M_ribflv_b) to a supply rate of one unit
* other metabolites in the minimal medium (M_nh4_b, M_o2_b, M_pi_b, M_so4_b, M_ca2_b, M_cl_b, M_fe2_b, M_k_b, M_na1_b, M_h_b, M_h2o_b) have unlimited supply
* the resultant model has maximum growth rate 1.689
* .. though growth is independent of glucose


recon 2.1.2

split biomass reaction into its constituent parts
biomass = protein + DNA + RNA + carbohydrate + lipid + other
as described in the recon 2 paper, supplementary note 2


recon 2.1.3

* re-added CHARGE that went missing during the 2 -> 2.1 conversion
* add new tranport reactions as described in pmid:24653705, and defined by TransportModule13820.mat
* .. and modifications to existing transporters described at the end of supplementary table 2


recon 2.1.4
* add drug metabolism as described in pmid:25345908


recon 2.1.5
* removed splice variants from the model
* corrected GENE_ASSOCIATION bracketing error for R_ATPS4m
* rebuilt GENE_ASSOCIATIONs in disjunctive normal form, with lists of alternative complexes: "(E1 and E2) or (E1 and E3)", rather than "E1 and (E2 or E3)"


recon 2.1.6
* made set of changes as described in pmid:24907410 and defined by Supplementary File 2
